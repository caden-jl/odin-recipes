I am using HTML to curate recipes by creating a main index with links to 
individual recipes, posting images of finished dishes, listing titles, 
ingredients, and cooking steps, and linking to websites where they can 
be found. I will add more styling and formatting as I continue learning CSS. 

I want to practice building the skills I have only tried a few times 
while learning about the process of building a site. I wish to become 
very familiar with how to use HTML and CSS to create webpages.
