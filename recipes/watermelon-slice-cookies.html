    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>red and green gel food coloring</li>
        <li>1/3 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips or raisins, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. 
        Beat in egg and extract. In another bowl, whisk flour, baking powder 
        and salt; gradually beat into creamed mixture. Reserve 1 cup dough.</li>

        <li>Tint remaining dough red; shape into a 3-1/2-in.-long roll and wrap. 
            Tint 1/3 cup of reserved dough green; wrap. Wrap remaining plain 
            dough. Refrigerate 2 hours or until firm.</li>

        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll plain dough into an 
            8-1/2x3-1/2-in. rectangle. Unwrap red dough and place on a 
            short end of the plain dough; roll up.</li>
        
        <li>Roll green dough into a 10x3-1/2-in. rectangle. Place red 
            and plain roll on a short end of the green dough; roll up. 
            Wrap and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Unwrap and cut dough into 3/16-in. 
            slices (just less than 1/4 in.). Place 2 in. apart on ungreased 
            baking sheets. Lightly press chocolate chips and, if desired, 
            sesame seeds into red dough to resemble watermelon seeds.</li>

        <li>Bake 9-11 minutes or until firm. Immediately cut cookies 
            in half. Remove to wire racks to cool.</li>
